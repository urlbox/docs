description: Get notified when a screenshot has been rendered.

Webhooks allow your application to receive information when a screenshot has been rendered. This allows you to render screenshots asynchronously.

Pass a webhook URL in as the `webhook_url` option and Urlbox will send a POST request back to that URL with data about the screenshot in JSON format once it has completed rendering.

```zsh
curl -X POST \
https://api.urlbox.io/v1/render \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer your-urlbox-secret' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"url":"example.com", "webhook_url":"https://example.com/webhooks/urlbox"}'
```

This will result in a response like the following being posted to `https://example.com/webhooks/urlbox` once the render is complete:

```json
{
  "event": "render.succeeded",
  "renderId": "19a59ab6-a5aa-4cde-86cb-d2b23302fd84",
  "result": {
    "renderUrl": "https://renders.urlbox.io/urlbox1/renders/6215a3df94d7588f7d910513/2022/7/6/19a59ab6-a5aa-4cde-86cb-d2b23302fd84.png",
    "size": 34097
  },
  "meta": {
    "startTime": "2022-07-06T17:49:18.593Z",
    "endTime": "2022-07-06T17:49:21.103Z"
  }
}
```

~> Urlbox also accepts `HEAD` requests, in case you just want to get the response status/headers without pulling down the full response body.

Webhooks are often used in combination with our <a href="/docs/options#storage-options">S3 storage options</a> making it easy for you to gather large numbers of screenshots asynchronously.

You can verify Urlbox as the source of a webook using the value of the `x-urlbox-signature` header. You can find your webhook secret from within the project settings in your Urlbox dashboard. You will then be able to validate the signatures in the webhooks you receive.
