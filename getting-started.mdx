---

The quickest way to get started with Urlbox is to use the synchronous `GET` API.

## Request Format

To generate your first render, send a `GET` request to the following URL:

<UrlboxUrl>https://api.urlbox.io/v1/api-key/format?options</UrlboxUrl>

Where:

- <Highlight>api-key</Highlight> is replaced with your Urlbox API key, which you
  can get by <a href="/pricing">registering</a> for an account

- <Highlight variant="format">format</Highlight> is one of: `png` `jpg` `jpeg` `avif`
  `webp` `pdf` `svg` `html` `md` `webm` `mp4`

- <Highlight variant="query">options</Highlight> is replaced by a query string that
  contains all of the options you want to set - for example:

  - `url=example.com&full_page=true&width=300`

## Response Format

When you send a `GET` request in this way, the Urlbox API will return binary data as the response, with the `Content-Type` header set to the relevant MIME type for the format requested. For example, if you requested `png` format, the `Content-Type` will be `image/png` and response body will be the actual `PNG` binary data.

This means that you can insert the request URL directly into an `<img>` or `<meta>` tag, and things should _just work_.

~> Urlbox also accepts `HEAD` requests, in case you just want to get the response status/headers without pulling down the full response body.

Let's say you want to render a `png` screenshot of `google.com` thumbnailed down to 300px wide - you could set an `<img>` tag's `src` attribute like so:

```html
<img
  src="https://api.urlbox.io/v1/api-key/png?url=google.com&thumb_width=300"
  alt="Urlbox API thumbnail screenshot of google.com"
/>
```

and the result would be:

<div className="doc-img center mx-auto">

![urlbox.io API showing a screenshot thumbnail of google.com](https://api.urlbox.io/v1/ca482d7e-9417-4569-90fe-80f7c5e1c781/17ece442b26c8518328a5ae2b8b851359e2d4a20/png?url=google.com&thumb_width=300)

</div>
