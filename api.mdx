## Intoduction

Urlbox is a service that generates high quality screenshots, PDFs and other outputs from website URLs and HTML.

## Base URL

The base URL for all API requests is `https://api.urlbox.io`.

## Authentication

{/* Urlbox uses **Bearer** authentication. */}

To authenticate an API request, provide your **secret** key in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_SECRET_KEY}
```

You can generate a secret key by creating a Project. When you first sign up, Urlbox automatically creates a default project for you.

## Errors

Errors are returned in JSON format, with a relevant status code, and a human readable `message`. A `code` will also be returned in some cases.

```json caption="example error object"
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Please confirm your email to continue using the API"
    "code": "NotConfirmed"
  }
}
```

## Endpoints

A render is our generic term for anything that can be generated by the API, for example a screenshot is a render, a pdf is a render, so too is a video. You can create all kinds of render using the same endpoint, by specifying the options relevant to that render kind.

### Create a render synchronously

<SplitPane>
  <Pane>
    Creating a render synchronously is achieved by calling this endpoint.

    This endpoint responds with `200 OK` once the render has been generated. The response body will contain a `renderUrl` key which is a temporary URL pointing to the generated render. This URL will expire after 30 days.

    ### Parameters

    | Name | Type | Description |
    | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
    | url | string | The URL to render |
    | html | string | The HTML to render |
    | format | string | The output format of the render. One of `png`, `jpg`,`webp`, `pdf`, `svg`, `mp4`,`webm`,`md` |
    | width | integer | The width of the viewport in pixels |
    | height | integer | The height of the viewport in pixels |
